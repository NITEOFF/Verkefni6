### Why is it important to save a BitLocker recovery key?
Answer The recovery key is needed for you to gain access to the computer in the event the password is forgotten, or in the event of certain hardware problems, such as a motherboard replacement or hard drive crash, or even after performing a BIOS update. Without it, there is no way to access your data.

### Are there any you would recommend changing? Why?
The student may not understand all the settings. However, the student should be able to provide at least one example of a User Rights Assignment security setting that should be changed. Although the computer is stand-alone, this does not mean that it is not on a network. Stand-alone, in this case, means the computer is not a part of an Active Directory domain. Therefore, many of the User Rights Assignment settings could be changed to better protect the computer on the LAN. For example, the Access this computer from the network security setting defaults to allow everyone network access. The student might recommend that only the Administrator group be allowed access.
